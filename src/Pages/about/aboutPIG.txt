Crazy? I was crazy once.
They put me in a rubber room.
A round rubber room
And told me to sit in the corner.
Corner? There was no corner
So I sat in the middle of the floor
Surrounded by rats.
Rat? I can't stand rats.
They tickled my feet.
They made me laugh.
I laughed so hard I thought I would die
Die? I did die in there.
They buried me in a hole.
A hole six feet under the ground
And that's when the worms came.
Worms? I hate worms.
They burrowed into my skull And started to eat my brain.
They drove me crazy!
Crazy? I was crazy once.
They put me in a rubber room.
A round rubber room
And told me to sit in the corner.
